# watch-and-execute
A simple command line tool for watching a specific directory and (re)-executing a specific command on 
every change. âš¡

# Motivation:
Smithy is a a great Interface Definition Language. Smithy4s is a codegen for generating Scala code based on Smithy files.
It is somehow tedious to manually regenerate the SCala code on each smithy change.

Watching the `.smihty` files and regenerate the code programatically is here.ðŸ”¥
