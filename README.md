# watch-and-execute
A simple command line tool for watching a specific directory and (re)-executing a specific command on 
every change. âš¡

# Motivation:
Smithy is a a great IDL. Smithy4s is a codegen for generating `.scala` code based on `.smithy` code.
It is somehow tedious to manually regenerate the `scala` code on each `smithy` change.

Watching the `.smihty` files and regenerate the code programatically is here.ðŸ”¥
