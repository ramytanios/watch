A simple `watch` command line tool for watching a specific directory and 
(re)-executing a specific command on every change, with possible throttling. âš¡

Using [Scala-CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) as build tool. âœ…

Based on the Scala  [typelevel](https://typelevel.org/) stack. âœ…

# Motivation
[Smithy](https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html) is a a great Interface Definition Language. [Smithy4s](https://disneystreaming.github.io/smithy4s/) is a codegen for generating Scala code based on Smithy files.
It is certainly tedious to manually regenerate the Scala code on each smithy file change.

ðŸ‘‰Watching the `.smithy` files and regenerate the corresponding Scala code programatically is certainly more idiomatic.

# Example usage
```bash
# Watch the directory `test_dir/` and exectude the `ls` command
mkdir test_dir
watch --path test_dir --cmd ls --arg la
```
